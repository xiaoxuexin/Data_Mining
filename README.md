# Data_Mining

This is based on the STATS 415: data mining and statistical learning. I just uploaded the homework projects into this file.

The projects were writen in the form of R Markdown. The main goals is data analysis rather than writing the code by ourselves compared with other python or C++ code in other documents.

By using packages in R, we realized many algorithms in machine learning, such as visualization, linear regression, K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA), logistic regression, Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection, Cross Validation,(Choosing Models Using the Validation Set Approach and Cross Validation
), Ridge Regression, Lasso, Principal Components Regression, Partial Least-Squares, Polynomial Regression, Splines, General Additive Model(GAM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines(SVM), Hierarchical Clustering, and K Means Clustering.
